## What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into the full software development lifecycle. Key learnings include:
*   Architecting a database schema from scratch and adapting it for different SQL dialects (SQLite vs. MySQL).
*   Implementing a secure, session-based authentication system.
*   Solving real-world deployment challenges, including server configuration (WSGI), dependency management, and production-specific bugs like "cold starts."
*   Building a complete, responsive UI/UX from the ground up without relying on a framework like Bootstrap.
